Vim Kick Pedal
====

This project allows you to enter and exit VI's insert mode using a rock band pedal! Similar to Alexander Levchuk's [project](https://github.com/alevchuk/vim-clutch). 


Equipment
----

Required equipment:
+ PSOC 4 prototyping kit: $4 + shipping

These can be bought from multiple sources. I got mine from [Cypress](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-4-cy8ckit-049-4xxx-prototyping-kits), but you might get a better deal on shipping elsewhere. We will only be using the usb to serial bridge so you can use the rest of the prototyping kit for another project.
+ Rock Band pedal

I found my rock band pedal at a thrift shop for $2. Many other pedals could work though since the implementation works by reading a GPIO.
